In the following section, I will step by step demonstration how a small organization or individual user can utilize Airtable to manage their data which is a relatively small collection. Here I use 2014 hksmff screening activity materials as a sample collection.  

In the repository, you will find the [2014_hksmff_basic_inventory](https://github.com/jyw321/Airtable_Exercise/blob/master/2014_hksmff_basic_inventory.csv) in a .csv file as the original raw file for Airtable importation. For the sake of demonstrating more functions, I changed some contents of the original records as shown on the hksmff website. At the end of this demonstration, you will find the link to the work base I created. 

### Demonstration 1. Start an account and import your own spreadsheet

You can create your own account on Airtable, or you can simply use your Google account.
![Create an account](https://github.com/jyw321/Airtable_Exercise/blob/master/Image_5.png)

Once you log in Airtable, you will see that Airtable has prepared some templates for you to start with based on your own needs (refer back to Img. 1). But you can always start from scratch or import your own spreadsheet to kick off a work base. 

1.On the “My First Workspace” interface, click “Add a base”
2.Choose “Import a spreadsheet”
> *(remember to save your original spreadsheet as .csv file)* 
3.Import the .csv file
4.Name and choose the style of this base (pick any color and icon you like!)
5.After the original .csv file is successfully imported, name the table “2014 films”
