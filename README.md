Airtable for Small-Scale Moving Image Archives and Individuals - An example of hong kong social movement film festival

In this project, I introduce a data management tool called Airtable, which is suitable for organizational or individual users. This is a tool remarkably friendly those people with little coding experience. This file serves as a historical background introduction of Airtable and a documentation of how to build a work base and how to maneuver a number of, in my opinion, most useful functions of Airtable to conduct data management, especially for audiovisual materials. In the GitHub repository, besides this step-by-step documentation, you will also find a raw inventory sheet and an Airtable work base sample. The basic idea here is, you can utilize the raw data to get familiarized with Airtable by following the steps in the documentation. In this process, you can have some knowledge on the pros and cons of the tool, so that in the future you can create your own work base.

Airtable is an online collaboration service headquartered in San Francisco. It was founded in 2012 by Howie Liu, Andrew Ofstad, and Emmett Nicholas. On Airtable’s homepage, the team cheerfully express their mission is “to democratize software creation by enabling anyone to build the tools that meet their needs. Creators and creatives around the world use Airtable to do everything from cattle tracking to filmmaking”.
By now, there are already more than 15 million work bases created on Airtable, and more than 80,000 companies use Airtable. Among the thousands of Airtable users, famous names include Tesla, WeWork, Cole Haan, Expedia, BuzzFeed, and so on. In May 2018, Airtable became one of Silicon Valley's sleeper hits, raised $52 million in new funding in a round led by Caffeinated Capital and CRV to bring its total to $62.6 million . Now, investors include Benchmark, Thrive Capital, CRV, Caffeinated Capital, and Coatue Management. 
The secret to Airtable's success, according to its CEO, Howie Liu, is the fact that every cell of a spreadsheet can store anything, including photos and lists. “We think we can be what Windows was for personal computing,” he said. “We're confident we can be the Apple or Microsoft of the low-end-app space.”  
Generally speaking, Airtable is a combination of spreadsheet and database on a colorful Excel-like or Google Form-like interface.
