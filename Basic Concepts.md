Before step-by-step demonstration, some basic but useful concepts of Airtable need clarification here. Actually, there are a lot more functions out there created by Airtable, but I will focus on the below ones which I believe are threshold knowledge for small organizations and individual users who hope to adopt Airtable. 

#### Base: 
A base is a collection of related tables, often reflecting a single project, process, or workflow that you collaborate on with your team

#### Revision history:
Airtable provides powerful ways to go back in time with record-level revision history and base snapshots. View a living history of all the changes that have been made to a single record and jump back in time and restore your base to a previous state.

#### Fields: 
At first glance, you can understand them as “columns” in an Excel sheet. Unlike a spreadsheet, Airtable fields (columns) have specific "types" that allow you to store rich content in each record. 

*(Notably, you can even insert photos, tables, hyperlinks and other objects into cells, simply by setting the type of the field as “Attachment”.)*
